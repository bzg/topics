#+title: Topics

Web application to expose topics.

#+html: <img src="topics.webp" />

* Install and run

Assuming [[https://github.com/babashka/bbin][bbin]] is installed:

#+begin_src sh
bbin install io.github.bzg/topics
#+end_src

Now suppose you have an =input.json= file structured like this:

#+begin_src json
[
  {
    "title": "Topic title",
    "content": "<p>HTML</p>",
    "category": "Category name"
  }
]
#+end_src

Running =~ topics input.json= will output an =index.html file.
